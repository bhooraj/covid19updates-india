We measure the Number of Active cases as:
Active Cases = Total cases - (Total Recovered/Discharged/Migrated + Total Deaths)

From 06.05.2020, the case status will be updated on the website only once a day in the morning instead of twice a day, as being done presently on Ministry of Health and Family Welfare website.
